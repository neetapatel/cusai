      <p>This course introduces students to graphic design as both an art medium and a form of communication. Students will produce communicative work in multiple formats (posters! zines! animations!) and explore visual problem-solving methods through a variety of in-class exercises. Participation in workshops, group discussions, guest lectures, and critiques will provide students with opportunities to develop their work with each other.</p>
