      <p>This course introduces students to graphic design as both an art medium and a form of communication. Students will produce communicative work in multiple formats (posters! zines! animations!) and explore visual problem-solving methods through a variety of in-class exercises. Participation in workshops, group discussions, guest lectures, and critiques will provide students with opportunities to develop their work with each other.</p>

      <summary class="title">Exercise: Dots & Lines (starts)</summary>
      <div class="exercise-description">
        <p>DOTS: Within an 8 x 8-inch square area and using a fine-tipped pencil or pen, fill the entire surface of the square with as many evenly spaced points as possible freehand. The goal is to populate the given area, using hand/eye coordination only, to create distinct and evenly distributed spacing around each point. It may take several attempts to get it done to your satisfaction.</p>
        <p>LINES 1: Using the same set-up as above (8 x 8-inch square), draw as many evenly spaced straight lines as possible across the square freehand; lines should be parallel to one edge of your square.</p>
        <p>LINES 2: Repeat, but draw lines on the diagonal across the square freehand.</p>
        <p>FORMAT: You may want to experiment with different densities (more or less white space). Please organize and save all sketches. The final pieces should be trimmed to size.</p>

        <p>As you’re out and about during the program, take note of interesting, attractive, ugly, or otherwise notable typography in your local environments. Take pictures and collect them in our class Are.na channel. We’ll come back to the channel as a group now and then to talk about what you’re seeing.</p>

      <summary class="title">Project: Poster Series (starts)</summary>
      <div class="project-description">
        <p>Create a series of three 24” x 36” visually-related posters that engage and respond to a subject you’re interested in. The goal is to conceptually and visually interpret, make yours, and communicate the main ideas, questions, and positions you are curious about in your subject. What do you want to say?</p>
        <p>Consider both analog and digital ways of making as you begin to brainstorm a list of potential topics. Maybe you will research images online, and collect typography to collage in from magazines and other ephemera. Maybe you will use the scanner to manipulate your analog work, digitize it, and/or reproduce it.

      <p class="title">Exercise: Draw the A’s</p>
      <div class="exercise-description">
        <p>Typography (which we will focus on next week) is just as much about shape and form as it is about what those letters come together to communicate. There are three letter A’s on the handout you will be given in class. Please replicate the letterforms by hand to the best of your ability. It may be helpful to draw gridlines over the printed letters (cap height, x-height, baseline) for reference as you work. You may want to make multiple copies of the sheet and practice drawing the letterforms in pencil before finalizing your drawing. It would be good practice to document your process for this exercise.</p>
        <p>Your finished piece should be a clean copy with the letterforms inked in black. When inking your final letterforms, it may be helpful to use pens with different sized tips (thinner tips for edges and broader ones for filling in).</p>
