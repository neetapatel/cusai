      <p>This course introduces students to graphic design as both an art medium and a form of communication. Students will produce communicative work in multiple formats (posters! zines! animations!) and explore visual problem-solving methods through a variety of in-class exercises. Participation in workshops, group discussions, guest lectures, and critiques will provide students with opportunities to develop their work with each other.</p>

      <div class="project-description">
        <p>Today's class session will be dedicated to wrapping up your poster projects. By the end of class, please have at least one poster printed and/or produced at its final size. It's OK if your posters are unfinished, or if what you have is a bit sketchy! This was a quick project. Erhan and I will be available to help you print. We will be sharing our posters with a guest critic later this week!</p>

      <div class="project-description">
        <p>Choose a Wikipedia page on something you’re fascinated by. Design a 16-page split-fold zine using any combination of the text and images on your chosen page. Consider other forms of text as well, such as footnotes, hyperlinks, references, external links, etc. What opportunities do they present? How can they be integrated, emphasized, highlighted, or made visible or invisible?</p>
        <p>The Wikipedia page should be your foundation, but feel free to incorporate other forms of media and imagery to support your publication.</p>
